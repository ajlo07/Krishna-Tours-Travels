                        </h5>
                        <p class="mb-0">Kedarnath is a revered pilgrimage site situated in Uttarakhand, India. Nestled
                            at an altitude of 3,583 meters in the majestic Himalayas, it holds immense religious
                            significance for Hindus. The town is home to the ancient Kedarnath Temple, dedicated to Lord
                            Shiva, believed to have been built by the Pandavas from the Mahabharata. This sacred temple
                            is one of the twelve Jyotirlingas, symbolizing Lord Shiva's cosmic light.

                                To reach Kedarnath, pilgrims embark on a challenging 16-kilometer trek from Gaurikund,
                                passing through picturesque landscapes, meadows, and valleys. The temple's grandeur,
                                constructed with large stone slabs, leaves visitors in awe of its spiritual ambiance.
                                Surrounding Kedarnath are breathtaking snow-capped peaks, including the majestic
                                Kedarnath Peak. The holy Mandakini River flows near the temple, enhancing the serenity
                                of the area.

                                Kedarnath attracts millions of devotees and tourists annually, who seek blessings and a
                                connection with the divine. The pilgrimage season begins in April or May, continuing
                                until October or November. During this time, visitors offer prayers and immerse
                                themselves in the profound spirituality of the temple.</p>
